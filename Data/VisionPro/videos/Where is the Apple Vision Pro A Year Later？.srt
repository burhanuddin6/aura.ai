1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
a year ago Apple released the Apple

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,200
Vision Pro their first spatial Computing

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,559
headset and for the first week it really

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,000
seemed like everyone excitedly went out

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,839
to buy a $3500 headset until 2 weeks

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,799
later when the content all dried up

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,920
because everyone who bought one returned

8
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:20,560
it but you know what I didn't so here's

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,960
what it's like using the Apple Vision

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,359
Pro one year later from someone who

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,599
didn't return the Apple Vision Pro is it

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,199
any better well let's talk about it okay

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,800
so to understand where it is today we

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,840
have to do a little bit of a

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,280
retrospective first why did everyone

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,160
find this thing so cool in the first

17
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,960
place well with every Apple product

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,320
launch there's some slick marketing and

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,760
hype maybe a little too much hype for a

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,840
product that seemed to have been rumored

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,039
forever VR and AR experiences are some

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,079
of the coolest things that you can try

23
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,920
for the first time for about 15 minutes

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,760
until the novelty wears off and you look

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,320
yourself in the mirror and realize just

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,719
how you look but honestly the Apple

27
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,320
Vision Pro is definitely a vision or

28
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,760
glimpse into the future of what good AR

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,519
and VR could be the you Y and resolution

30
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,000
is crisp and using just your hands

31
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:06,000
instead of a physical controller

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,080
genuinely does feel like the future you

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,040
can enjoy working in 3D spaces with

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,640
Windows and displays everywhere or you

35
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,520
can immerse yourself in a film with a

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,240
giant display right in front of you and

37
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,799
while there are limited games the games

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,640
that do work you can run them pretty

39
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,200
decently it's absolutely insane that all

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,840
of this could be done with today's Tech

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,520
in a device like this and for that

42
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,000
purpose it just can't be beat but

43
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,439
there's also many many different reasons

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
why it didn't stick for for regular

45
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,439
people first is price and the value that

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,159
you get for that price what it does

47
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,520
better than just owning a regular Mac

48
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,240
and a different VR headset is outshined

49
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,360
by just how much cheaper those things

50
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,479
are at doing those tasks and where the

51
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,680
Vision Pro excels and does things better

52
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,200
than any computer or VR headset can even

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,880
do doesn't justify paying that crazy

54
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,159
price tag don't get me wrong it's

55
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,159
fantastic and impressive every single

56
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,520
time you put the Vision Pro on nothing

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,759
comes close to it but it's an experience

58
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,320
that I don't think everyone deems is

59
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,880
worth 32 Grand there hasn't been a

60
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,439
single discount since it's been released

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,080
either then there's also how difficult

62
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,000
it is to show people visually how the

63
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,920
Apple Vision Pro Works Apple initially

64
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,800
released it in the US before expanding

65
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,200
to a couple more countries but at least

66
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,760
here in the US the only retailer that

67
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,400
sells the Apple Vision Pro is Apple so

68
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,440
it's not easy to just walk into your

69
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,000
local electronic store and try it out

70
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,800
and see if you like it you have to go

71
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,080
specifically to an Apple store which

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,720
there are way less of just to try it or

73
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,400
order it online line and I don't know

74
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,560
about you if I don't know much about a

75
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,959
product I'm not quick to drop 3 and2

76
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,840
Grand on something unseen and it doesn't

77
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,400
help that even in YouTube videos it's a

78
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,280
pain trying to show what using the

79
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,879
experience is like on camera since you

80
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,159
typically just get a standard 4K 2D

81
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,000
video of how it looks versus the entire

82
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,360
immersive view that you would with the

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,360
headset on like this video doesn't do it

84
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,760
justice then there's the device itself

85
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,280
it's nice to touch in the hand has lots

86
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,319
of Glass and Metal it's very premium

87
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,319
built but it's heavy it's hard to wear

88
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,680
comfortably for long periods of time and

89
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,360
takes up a ton of space in your backpack

90
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,360
so it's super inconvenient to use when

91
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,920
traveling making that private movie

92
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,040
viewing experience a huge hassle to Lug

93
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,040
around with you through airports I mean

94
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,319
you can fit like three pairs of clothes

95
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,280
in the space that A Vision Pro takes up

96
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,879
in a bag some people have issues with

97
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,799
the look but honestly I don't think

98
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,879
that's a major issue at all I mean they

99
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,640
are a bit strange but everyone made fun

100
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:29,360
of airpods when they came out calling

101
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,200
them toothbrush heads but after a few

102
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
years they were everywhere also because

103
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,799
these things are so expensive and so few

104
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,200
people have them using them is a very

105
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,879
lonely and isolating experience both as

106
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,000
an owner and the fact that when you're

107
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:44,159
using it it feels disconnected from the

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,840
physical world with very few ways to

109
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,040
share what you're experiencing and in

110
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,400
full immersion and lastly the biggest

111
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,480
issue with the Vision Pro at release was

112
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,360
that the app library and features were

113
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,200
just not enticing there just weren't

114
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,959
that many apps made specifically for the

115
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,360
Vision Pro I mean it did have iPad app

116
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,120
support but that was also pretty Limited

117
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,480
at launch the main issues were the high

118
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,959
price tag the barrier to actually use it

119
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,120
in action or try it the lack of great

120
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,439
apps and software and the overall

121
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,799
comfort of the device which all led to

122
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,040
an impressive device that doesn't feel

123
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,359
ready for Mass Appeal but okay Jimmy

124
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,440
that was all last year at release a lot

125
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:26,479
of things can change in 365 days but

126
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,360
does it change whether anyone should get

127
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,360
an Apple Vision Pro today well first the

128
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,840
device itself is a lot better Apple has

129
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,919
dropped new software updates that

130
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,600
probably should have been there from the

131
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,400
beginning like more screen real estate

132
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,400
when you mirror your Mac display new

133
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,360
gesture controls that make it easier to

134
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,960
access everything from your fingertips

135
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,840
instead of looking up to pull in the

136
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,000
control center and finally a better

137
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,080
guest mode that saves the previous guest

138
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,919
so that they don't have to go through

139
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,840
the annoying setup and the OS itself

140
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,919
does feel a bit more stable than it did

141
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,759
at launch all these software tweaks are

142
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,280
nice additions and make the Vision Pro

143
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,360
feel more complete and cohesive within

144
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,919
the Apple ecosystem but again it feels

145
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,120
like these features should have been

146
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,840
here in the first place but it still

147
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,800
does make the Vision Pro nicer to use

148
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,080
especially the giant ultrawide Mac

149
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,120
virtual display it just came way too

150
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,600
late I find that a good informal Health

151
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,000
indicator of how popular a tech product

152
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,000
is and how people use their device is

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,639
the third party accessory markets for it

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
all big electronic purchases whether

155
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,160
that's a laptop tablet smartphone game

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,639
console or even a camera have

157
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,240
accessories and you know once you get

158
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,560
your shiny new electronics you're

159
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,240
already planning some accessory

160
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,280
purchases for it so just a quick glance

161
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,600
on Apple's website and Amazon shows you

162
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,000
two things one how few accessories there

163
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,120
are for the Vision Pro and two how few

164
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,560
people are actually buying these

165
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,639
accessories it doesn't seem like the

166
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,400
Apple Vision Pro is all that popular at

167
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,160
least from an accessory standpoint and

168
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,280
even when looking at Google trends for

169
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,639
the Apple Vision Pro it seems like the

170
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,880
overall hype for this device is just

171
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,759
straight up dead so while the software

172
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,039
is a lot better A year later the

173
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,800
accessories market for the Vision Pro

174
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,600
and how many people people actually have

175
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,680
purchased this Vision Pro seems tiny

176
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,680
especially by Apple product standards so

177
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,680
the Apple Vision Pro has gotten better

178
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,919
over the last year even if sales are

179
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,360
sluggish but they don't live in a vacuum

180
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,800
there are other companies that are

181
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,000
working on better and better headsets as

182
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,919
well Samsung has their project muhan

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,520
headset that looks a little too similar

184
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,000
to the Apple Vision Pro it could

185
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,039
potentially be really interesting and

186
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,319
might be a solid alternative or you

187
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:31,120
could look at what's available on the

188
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,199
market today like meta Quest 3s which is

189
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,560
already a compelling headset which by

190
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,160
the way this thing costs 10 times less

191
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,599
than the Apple Vision Pro one thing I

192
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,199
want to make 100% clear is that this

193
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,319
thing is not a competitor to division

194
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,160
Pro so the comparisons are a little

195
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,919
unfair there if you're comparing what

196
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,160
type of things you can accomplish with

197
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,639
both device but what this does do is

198
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,160
give us an idea of how cheap VR and AR

199
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,199
headsets can get as well as how good

200
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,680
they can be at this price point what

201
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,240
regular everyday people can afford The

202
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,960
Vision Pro like inside is technically so

203
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,080
impressive it's got plenty of power

204
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,960
thanks to that M2 Chip and the displays

205
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,240
are beautiful it just doesn't have

206
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,160
enough going for it to justify that

207
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,199
large price tag while the meta Quest 3s

208
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,440
nothing about this device screams

209
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,479
premium but it's comfortable to wear has

210
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,000
the option to use controllers or finger

211
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,360
gestures to navigate the device and it's

212
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,840
cheap okay I hate making up random

213
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,280
numbers to describe my personal

214
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,520
experience but the Vision Pro experience

215
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,479
feels about three times better than the

216
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,919
meta Quest 3s now does it justify it

217
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,280
being 10 times more expensive for that

218
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:44,000
three times better experience no but

219
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,759
that's kind of like comparing a $300 TV

220
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,039
you see in a store to a $3,000 premium

221
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,159
OLED TV they both do the job but the

222
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,720
comparisons just aren't Fair could you

223
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:56,520
argue that a fancy money shredding OLED

224
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,560
TV does a job 10 times better than that

225
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,159
budget brand no but it's the latest and

226
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,159
greatest flagship and you're paying a

227
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,440
premium to be cutting edge that's kind

228
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:06,280
of what the Vision Pro is right now but

229
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,319
what will be interesting at least to me

230
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,560
is out of these two or any other

231
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,000
competitors that enter the market who

232
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,759
can reach that sweet sweet Middle Ground

233
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,360
first where you get nice premium

234
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,599
features that you see in the Vision Pro

235
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,400
today at a reasonable price that's when

236
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:23,680
I think these VR AR XR whatever you want

237
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,479
to call them spatial Computing devices

238
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,000
would be really interesting all right so

239
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,680
what's next for the Apple Vision Pro

240
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,319
well I think that Apple's just going to

241
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,680
look forward and try this path a little

242
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,599
bit longer there's rumors that

243
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,800
production ended for the Vision Pro in

244
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,599
late 2024 due to lower than expected

245
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,080
sales but that's not the end into

246
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,839
Apple's attempt into these type of

247
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,760
devices because apple is rumored to

248
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,160
release a more budget friendly version

249
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,399
sometime in the near future so in the

250
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,360
meantime they really should be

251
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,360
continuing to flesh out the features of

252
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,160
the Vision Pro so that when this new

253
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,959
cheaper model releases it'll hit the

254
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,800
ground running with a more thought out

255
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,040
OS hopefully you get some great apps

256
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,839
because it's still pretty Barren and is

257
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,800
mostly suited for consuming streamed

258
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,640
content there's also rumors that apple

259
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,480
and Sony are working together to support

260
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,120
PlayStation VR2 controllers with the

261
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,640
Vision Pro which could help it function

262
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,720
better as both a gaming machine because

263
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,480
the M series processors in there are

264
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,480
already pretty good at that and to just

265
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,040
navigate with VR controls because doing

266
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,680
everything with hand gestures for an

267
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,320
extended period of time kind of just

268
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,320
drains you so was the hype around the

269
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,600
Apple Vision Pro unwarranted sort of

270
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,800
there's a reason why people were so

271
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,839
interested in this product it was and

272
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,240
still is a really interesting piece of

273
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,120
technology like this proves that it can

274
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,040
be done with the tech that we have today

275
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,839
but it also shows us how far away we are

276
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,800
from this actually being useful to the

277
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,920
average person it'll be years before

278
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,800
this type of Technology becomes small

279
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,160
enough comfortable enough powerful

280
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,519
enough and cheap enough to actually be

281
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,760
accessible to everyone because let's be

282
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,399
real if this thing was like $1,500

283
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,640
comfortable to wear for long periods of

284
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,839
time less bulky and had a much more

285
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,800
robust app ecosystem this thing would

286
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,360
sell a lot better but until then

287
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,959
headsets like the Apple Vision Pro will

288
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,000
probably remain pretty Niche for a while

289
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,640
but hopefully a device like this spurred

290
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,120
up the competition a bit so that we as

291
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,839
consumers get way more competition maybe

292
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,839
meta will make a successor to The Meta

293
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,800
Quest Pro or Samsung makes a retail

294
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,000
version of their project muhan headset

295
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,920
who knows either way this isn't the

296
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,720
first time that we've seen an AR VR XR

297
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,240
spatial Computing headset it won't be

298
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,399
the last time we see something like this

299
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,519
either so for me personally today in

300
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,360
February

301
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,720
2025 would I rather own this or save

302
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,200
$3,500 I'd rather save $3500 anyway what

303
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,120
do you personally think did you consider

304
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,680
the Apple Vision Pro has your opinion on

305
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,279
it changed honestly I had some hope for

306
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,760
it but it feels largely the same a year

307
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,760
later despite some of the main software

308
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,320
updates the app ecosystems just still

309
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,720
isn't there for me leave all that down

310
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:59,079
in the comment section below and I'll

311
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,079
see you all next time bye
