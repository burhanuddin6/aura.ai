1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:00,940
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,450
- All right, so you've seen the unboxing.

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,040
Now it's time for the breakdown.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,903
What is using the Apple Vision Pro actually like?

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,210
This is easily one of Apple's craziest, most radical,

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,970
possibly dystopian products of all time.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,370
And I have a lot of thoughts here,

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,440
like I've been using it for about a week now.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,700
There are some parts of this thing

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,500
that are absolutely incredible,

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,870
and some other parts that feel weird,

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,060
or borderline unfinished.

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,920
There are all kinds of new technologies,

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,460
from a new operating system to infrared eye tracking

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,610
to virtually reconstructed versions of you.

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,120
I feel like there are so many actually new things

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,190
that you have to understand in order to get a sense

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,800
of what this headset actually is and what it does.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,380
So I'm gonna break this down into two parts.

20
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,010
This video is all about using the Vision Pro.

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,720
It's everything I've learned from the past week

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,260
of wearing and getting used to this thing every single day.

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,530
But I'm also working on a more wide ranging,

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,230
possibly more existential, review video.

25
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,300
But let's just start with the more

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,490
hardware fundamentals, right?

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,790
Like what is this thing that I'm holding literally?

28
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,280
Apple Vision Pro at its core,

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,230
well, it is a VR headset.

30
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,610
Now, Apple would never say that,

31
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,040
and they probably won't like that I'm saying that word.

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,360
You know, I made an entire video

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,520
about why they refuse to use those words,

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,850
and they're calling it spatial computing instead.

35
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,683
We'll get there.

36
00:01:30,683 --> 00:01:33,300
But the truth is it's a really, really, really high end

37
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,550
virtual reality headset.

38
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,410
It's something we've seen before, right?

39
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,530
It's got displays and lenses and speakers

40
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,420
and fans and buttons.

41
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,010
And this is a form factor.

42
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,230
This is a thing that we have seen before,

43
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,120
but before I even turn this thing on,

44
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,860
there are clearly several things

45
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,960
that are a little different about this one.

46
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,940
So first of all, it's made of metal.

47
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,420
Lots of metal and glass here, which are high quality,

48
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,570
but heavy materials, relatively speaking.

49
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,510
So there's this precisely machined aluminum frame

50
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,470
around the outside.

51
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,260
And yes, those are intakes for fans at the bottom.

52
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,660
And then vents for those fans at the top.

53
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,340
On the right side, there's your digital crown

54
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,140
that can be pressed in or turned.

55
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,320
And then on the other side is just a single larger button.

56
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,780
So kind of basically the same two buttons as an Apple Watch.

57
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,040
And then when you get a little further back

58
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,260
on this band here, these little pods

59
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,230
with downward facing grills, these are speakers

60
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,240
which are pointed straight at your ears,

61
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,830
and work surprisingly well.

62
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,010
Though of course, it also means that people around you

63
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,170
can hear a little bit of what you're hearing.

64
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,430
There's a little bit of bleed,

65
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,650
and I have a lot to say about spatial audio,

66
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,120
so stay tuned for that.

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,430
But the main event is at the front.

68
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,667
There is an enormous piece of glass,

69
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:47,160
which, yes, is very easy to fingerprint and smudge.

70
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,140
And then behind that thing, there's this outward-facing

71
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,350
OLED display and a bunch of sensors all the way around,

72
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,780
outside facing sensors that go forward,

73
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,150
sideways, and straight down.

74
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,580
And there's depth sensors, infrared illuminators,

75
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,180
lidar scanners, and just regular old RGB cameras,

76
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,580
all being processed by an M2 chip

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,740
and an R1 chip inside this thing.

78
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,270
And then maybe the craziest part,

79
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,450
inside the headset, there are a bunch more sensors

80
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,990
facing your eyes, tracking your eyes in real time,

81
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,360
for all the eye control and everything that comes with that.

82
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,350
And also then to display a representation of your eyes

83
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,870
on the outside of the headset.

84
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,640
Kinda, we'll get there.

85
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,530
But overall, when you put it all together,

86
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,190
you get a very well made, very high end,

87
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,150
but also pretty heavy computer to wear on your face.

88
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,510
So officially, this headset with this solo knit band

89
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,410
when I weighed it, showed up as 638 grams,

90
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,480
which some of you on Twitter have already pointed out

91
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,500
is actually slightly less than the plastic Meta Quest Pro.

92
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,380
But that Quest Pro also has a lot of battery

93
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,680
on the back of your head as a sort of a counterbalance,

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,770
so the weight distribution is very different.

95
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,080
Also, the Quest Pro is not that comfortable anyway.

96
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,680
But the point is this, for Apple, made the choice

97
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,000
of taking the battery off of the headset, which means okay,

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,380
now there's nothing on the back of your head,

99
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,540
so you can wear it and lean up against things,

100
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,220
and that might be an upside,

101
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,110
but that also now means you have to deal

102
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,290
with this cable all the time running up to your head,

103
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,380
and the fact that it's very front weighted now.

104
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,360
All of the weight is on the front of your face.

105
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,970
So this is the battery, as you saw in the unboxing.

106
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,400
If you haven't already seen the unboxing, that just went up.

107
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,420
I'll link it below the like button.

108
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,940
But this battery is a surprisingly small

109
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,550
3,366 milliamp hours.

110
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,580
I say surprisingly small because a normal battery bank

111
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,627
of this size, you might expect to be 10, 15,

112
00:04:41,627 --> 00:04:43,110
20,000 milliamp hours.

113
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,680
I suspect there's a lot of heat insulation happening here.

114
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,740
But it comes with a non-removable four foot cable,

115
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,320
and a proprietary connector at the end of the cable

116
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,270
that will twist and lock to the headset.

117
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,680
And so the lock is really solid.

118
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,390
It makes sense that it's not just straight USB

119
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,980
that could get disconnected easily.

120
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,290
Once you connect it, it starts glowing,

121
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,550
and then it starts booting up.

122
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,830
And there's even a little Apple logo that displays

123
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,590
on the outside screen while it takes, you know,

124
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,030
a little under a minute to turn on.

125
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,860
So there is no on or off button

126
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,570
or switch anywhere on this headset.

127
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,670
Maybe kind of like AirPods Max or something like that.

128
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,830
So if you ever take the headset off

129
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,380
and put it down, it will enter a standby mode

130
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,630
after some time, but it won't turn off.

131
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,840
If you wanna turn it off, you literally have to twist

132
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,250
and unplug the cable.

133
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,980
That's the only way to actually turn the headset off.

134
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,530
Now famously already, the battery life

135
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,170
with this included battery, is not super long

136
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,460
on this headset.

137
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,590
Two to four hours is actually realistic

138
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,130
for what you can expect for just like this built-in battery.

139
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,540
But that's also kind of right in line

140
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,800
with a lot of other VR headsets.

141
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,320
Battery life on VR headsets is not that great in general.

142
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,602
If you do wanna use it longer, the only way to do that

143
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:51,510
is there's USBC port on the battery,

144
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,430
and you have to plug the battery in.

145
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,170
So you could plug the battery into the wall

146
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,850
for infinite battery life,

147
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,560
or I guess you could plug it into like a,

148
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,530
you could daisy chain another battery into the other pocket

149
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,880
or something for even longer life.

150
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,680
But yeah, two to four hours.

151
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,910
Now at first it seemed weird to me

152
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,130
that the port is on the same side of the battery

153
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,420
as the non-removable cable,

154
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,730
but I think it's because they just want you to default

155
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,070
to putting this battery in your pocket,

156
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,330
probably in your back pocket.

157
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,520
So even if it's plugged into the wall,

158
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,100
it can still be in your back pocket.

159
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,200
You're just gonna want to get a longer USBC cable.

160
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,550
So there are no controllers that come with this headset.

161
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,170
Now it does support other input methods

162
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,140
that are like game controllers, and mouse, and keyboard,

163
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,880
and those can be incredibly useful,

164
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,670
but by default the primary input method

165
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,650
for everyone using the Vision Pro

166
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,230
is your eyes and your hands.

167
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,420
So the first time you put on this headset,

168
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,090
it goes through this calibration process,

169
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,590
and it's pretty interesting.

170
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,180
So the first time you ever put it on,

171
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,120
it first adjusts the distance between the lenses,

172
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,040
physically moving them inside the headset

173
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,020
to match the distance between your eyes.

174
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,820
Then it does this sort of a hand scan

175
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,960
so it understands your hands.

176
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,070
And then you go through this process

177
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,230
of basically looking at a bunch of dots

178
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,550
all the way around the screen,

179
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,190
and then tapping your fingers together to select them.

180
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,740
Kind of feels like an eye test or something.

181
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,573
And then you're in.

182
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:09,510
So first thing you're gonna notice

183
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,880
is you can actually kind of put your hands anywhere

184
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,030
as long as the headset can see this,

185
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,890
just your fingers touching together.

186
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,710
So there's a lot of pictures of people using a headset

187
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,090
with their fingers, like out in front of them,

188
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,170
pinching like that.

189
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,610
But you actually don't have to do that.

190
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,160
It's such a wide angle because of the sensors

191
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,590
facing forward and sideways and down.

192
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,050
You can kind of just rest your hand anywhere,

193
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,670
in front of you, in your lap.

194
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,930
As long as you pinch like that,

195
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,300
it can generally pick it up, which is impressive.

196
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,770
So you're pinching to control anywhere

197
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,630
in that 180 degree bubble in front of you.

198
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,600
And then the digital crown, you hit that once,

199
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,300
and the app drawer comes up, pretty simple.

200
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,530
Doesn't seem that impressive.

201
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,260
But this is actually a peek at the first really impressive

202
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,530
thing about this headset to me, which is it seems to have

203
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,010
incredible spatial positioning lock,

204
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:00,750
and like, it's really hard to have you appreciate this

205
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,920
through a YouTube video.

206
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,510
Reviewing VR headsets is hard.

207
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,160
But turn around in the room you're in,

208
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,760
and picture a wall or a window

209
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,760
just appearing locked in place in 3D space in your room,

210
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,510
and no matter how much you move your head,

211
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,000
or move around, it stays exactly kind of floating

212
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,840
where it's supposed to be.

213
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,360
But when I say floating, I think you're picturing like a,

214
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,320
a soft float, but it's locked, and that's how it starts.

215
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,220
So now you're in Apple's new Vision OS

216
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,630
I would describe this as kind of similar to iPad OS,

217
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,360
but way more glassy, and of course

218
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,970
with the extra dimension of 3D space.

219
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,400
So hitting a digital crown will always get the app drawer

220
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,030
back in front of you, and then simply look at the icon

221
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,620
you want and pinch your fingers together,

222
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,660
to select it and open that app.

223
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,940
Scrolling is basically as you'd expect,

224
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,130
you just kind of pinch and grab in the air,

225
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,410
and then pull as if it's on a string,

226
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,810
and physics let you pull things through the air.

227
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,470
It's pretty intuitive, it's responsive, it's fluid.

228
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,240
Sometimes it's kind of bouncy even.

229
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,340
I would say the biggest adjustment

230
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,590
is only being able to control

231
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,690
exactly what you're looking at.

232
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,890
And I don't think people realize

233
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,420
how often they're controlling things

234
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,910
that they're not exactly looking directly at

235
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,770
with other computers and other UIs.

236
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,400
But with this, you can look at the button to select it,

237
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,110
and if you look at the next thing you're gonna do,

238
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,610
you're no longer controlling the button.

239
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,470
You have to look exactly where you're trying

240
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,640
to interact with things.

241
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,170
It takes a few extra brain cycles

242
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,450
to remember to always be looking

243
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,100
exactly at the thing you're controlling.

244
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,980
So when you open a window of a Vision OS app,

245
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,290
like any one of the default Apple apps here,

246
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,600
it locks into place, it's floating there.

247
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,700
It kind of looks, again, like an iPad app,

248
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,700
but very glassy, like this frosted glass around the UI

249
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,110
sort of lets you see through a little bit

250
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,160
to the color behind it.

251
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,670
And it even sometimes casts a shadow on the ground

252
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,580
in the correct Z space, so it really solidifies

253
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,350
that it's floating in front of you.

254
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,360
All this makes it feel like the window

255
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,070
is in the space around you.

256
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,020
Then if you look at the bottom of the window,

257
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,900
you get a little bar, you can always just look at that bar

258
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,030
and pinch to drag it around.

259
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,210
So drag it forward, backward, anywhere you want

260
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,850
in X, Y, and Z space, and then let go

261
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,500
and it just stays absolutely locked.

262
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,350
And then you can look at either bottom corner to resize

263
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,000
to make it bigger or smaller.

264
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,430
And then finally there's a little X at the bottom,

265
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,170
you select that, that closes it.

266
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,470
So that is the basics of Vision OS,

267
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,850
and just using an app.

268
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,430
Now this entire time, by default,

269
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,700
and almost any time they can, passthrough is on,

270
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,140
which means you have the headset on,

271
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,970
but you can see with the cameras

272
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,320
right through to everything around you.

273
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,850
And I think this is where Apple really wants

274
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,150
to normalize the term spatial computing,

275
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,910
because it feels like augmented reality.

276
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,580
It feels like you're always able to see the space

277
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,190
around you, but technically it's not actually AR,

278
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,400
because you are still looking at a reconstructed version

279
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,200
through a camera feed of the world around you

280
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,630
instead of the actual world around you.

281
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,700
But maybe it's all just semantics.

282
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,660
I will say, this is the best passthrough of any VR headset

283
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,730
I've ever used, and it's not even that close.

284
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,450
Now again, it's so hard to get this through a YouTube video.

285
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,160
It does have screen recording built in,

286
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,330
so I'm gonna try to use that.

287
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,730
But imagine putting a headset on,

288
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,880
and not really feeling like you're looking at a screen

289
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,380
with the real world.

290
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,670
Because of the pixel density,

291
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,620
because of the 90 hertz refresh rate,

292
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,170
and because of the impressive dynamic range of the cameras

293
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,390
and the correctly adjusting shutter speed,

294
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,040
you just almost don't,

295
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,140
you almost just feel like you're looking

296
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,850
at the real world, not through a headset.

297
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,150
Also the passthrough is so close to real time

298
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,270
that I could legitimately interact with all kinds of things.

299
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,670
I could catch items flying at me.

300
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,620
I even tried playing ping pong.

301
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,420
It was easy, no hesitation.

302
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,360
So officially, the R1 chip is doing all the processing

303
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,340
of all this stuff and adjusting the shutter speed

304
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,480
for different lighting conditions

305
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,670
and always keeping passthrough latency

306
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,540
under 12 milliseconds, which is the lowest in the industry.

307
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,410
But it's really combining that with how close to reality

308
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,780
the colors and brightness and everything are

309
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,150
that keeps it feeling kind of real.

310
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,340
Basically, the only noticeable restriction

311
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,000
is super close up items and objects can get a bit blurry,

312
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,610
and then you can't quite make out really small

313
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,130
or fine texts, so you can't read an email

314
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,200
or a tiny text on your phone in your hand,

315
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,270
but you can absolutely text people,

316
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,730
or read your notifications, while keeping the headset on.

317
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,050
If you've tried other VR headsets,

318
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,310
you know how impressive that is.

319
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,460
It's just, it's really good with the tech

320
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,683
that exists now for VR headsets.

321
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,010
But you can definitely still take the headset off

322
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,990
and be like, oh, it's way brighter in here

323
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,580
than I thought it was.

324
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,800
Either way, that's all passthrough,

325
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,260
but if you ever wanna fully immerse yourself,

326
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,630
I mean it is a VR headset after all,

327
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,440
all you gotta do is rotate this digital crown clockwise,

328
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,360
just keep turning it, and it will slowly

329
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,380
dial your environment more and more into your field of view

330
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,990
until you dial it all the way up to fully surrounding you.

331
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,210
So all of the windows you might have had open

332
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,740
will still stay stuck where they were,

333
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,150
but everything you're doing is just on the moon now.

334
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,740
So yeah, there's a couple environments

335
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,150
Apple has built in here,

336
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,240
most of them relaxing scenic locations,

337
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,220
like in California somewhere,

338
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,230
or one really nice one is Mount Hood

339
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,760
with a little bit of rain falling.

340
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,610
They're not quite photorealistic,

341
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,710
but they're just short of photorealistic,

342
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,010
like they're the most realistic digital environments

343
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,843
that I've seen.

344
00:13:26,843 --> 00:13:31,843
So then the last two big quirks of the UI, control center.

345
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,780
So the only way to get to control center

346
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,180
is to look up, and you can't just look up,

347
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,040
but you have to physically turn your head up

348
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,660
and look at this arrow that appears above you.

349
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,250
So once you see that, you select that

350
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,380
and then you get your control center for things like,

351
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,380
you know, battery life and notifications, focus modes,

352
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,200
and screen recording, and pairing to a Mac.

353
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,470
But the other big quirk is text input.

354
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,350
So you might be wondering how does text input work

355
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,170
with no physical controllers?

356
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,240
So there's basically three ways to do this.

357
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,400
So let's say you are in Safari,

358
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,407
and you want to go to mkbhd.com.

359
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:07,320
You really want one of those shiny new Chevron hoodies

360
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,430
for the rest of winter.

361
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,660
Great, how do you do it?

362
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,780
So the first way is to literally hunt and peck

363
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,610
poking the keys on the keyboard

364
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,070
that appears in the air in front of you.

365
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,550
So this one is tough, because it literally only reacts

366
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,650
to your pointer finger on each hand.

367
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,060
So you actually can't type fast,

368
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,100
like with home row or anything like that.

369
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,933
Not great.

370
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,190
The second way, though, I think is actually kind of good.

371
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,280
It's at least faster, which is looking at the key

372
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,370
you want to interact with, and then pinching to select it.

373
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,160
So just looking around the keyboard like this,

374
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,060
and selecting the keys.

375
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,220
And you might be surprised how fast you can type like this

376
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,920
if you actually know your way around a keyboard pretty well.

377
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,070
I actually prefer this to poking the virtual keys

378
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,380
because I at least get a little bit of haptic feedback

379
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,510
from my own fingers tapping together.

380
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,100
But then in Safari, the last way to do it

381
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,990
is literally to just look up at the microphone

382
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,910
and say the URL out loud.

383
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,470
MKBHD.com.

384
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,460
And then it just hears you

385
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,500
and goes to the site pretty quick,

386
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,800
if it's a URL that you can actually say out loud.

387
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,450
So, what can you actually do with this thing?

388
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,780
Like now that we know what it is, it's the M2 chip,

389
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,600
a computer on your face with the displays

390
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,030
and the lenses inside, and all sorts of sensors everywhere.

391
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,710
What can this thing actually do?

392
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,720
And I feel like the most common way to phrase that

393
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,640
is what is the killer app?

394
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,560
Because that's, we feel like we need some sort

395
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,940
of justification to spend three, $4,000 on this thing.

396
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,600
Like applications made the iPhone what it is as we know it,

397
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,460
like apps made the iPad.

398
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,733
So what is the app situation on the Vision Pro?

399
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,080
So there are two types of apps on the Vision Pro, actually.

400
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,440
The first is apps that are built specifically

401
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,600
for the Vision Pro to take advantage

402
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,580
of its awesome experiences.

403
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,920
And there are a few of those right now,

404
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,140
and then there are all the other apps,

405
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,750
which basically are iPhone and iPad apps

406
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,910
that happen to be compatible

407
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,673
because the developer didn't opt out.

408
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,790
And the first kind is way cooler.

409
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,250
So these are Apple's stock apps here

410
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,780
that come with the Vision Pro.

411
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,620
And so these are all, of course, made just for Vision Pro.

412
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,320
So they're gonna have stuff that takes full advantage

413
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,760
of what this thing is capable of.

414
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,260
Apple Music is a pretty classic one,

415
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,910
like it has all the same functionality

416
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,230
of any other Apple Music app,

417
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,260
but in this super glassy frosted window,

418
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,720
and shows the colors of whatever's behind it.

419
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,500
And you have the sort of sorting menu on the left hand side

420
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,700
instead of across the bottom.

421
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,080
That's the basic layout.

422
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,180
Same thing with the Notes app and the Settings app.

423
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,210
Very glassy, almost looking like an iPad app in the air,

424
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,120
just rebuilt with this new material design.

425
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,070
And then there's the media apps.

426
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,090
So Apple TV and Disney+, they both come pre-installed,

427
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,760
which they have built entire environments

428
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,800
inside of them for watching media.

429
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,500
And there's even a small collection of videos

430
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,270
on the Apple TV app that are shot

431
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,740
on a new proprietary format

432
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,300
specifically for Vision Pro.

433
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,830
So it drops you into a space with a full 180 degree video,

434
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,110
and Alicia Keys walks right up to you

435
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,060
and starts singing right to your face.

436
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,893
It's crazy.

437
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:10,726
There's also the Photos app,

438
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:13,230
which will let you look at panoramic photos,

439
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,840
for example, in this fully immersive view.

440
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,000
So you can blow them up to full screen,

441
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,950
and then it gives you a bit of a parallax effect

442
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,260
around the edges, so it feels like you're looking

443
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,620
into a window of your own photo and looking around.

444
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,520
It's kind of incredible.

445
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,140
And then there's also some other really fun

446
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,580
third party apps that I've tried

447
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,570
that were built ahead of time.

448
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,280
So Sky Guide, this is a good one.

449
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,220
You can look around a real representation of the sky

450
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,390
around you or any of the constellations would normally be,

451
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,090
you can look at it a little longer and it'll pop it out.

452
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,920
You can pull it outta the sky

453
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,660
to get more information about it.

454
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,130
It's a pretty great idea.

455
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,050
There's another one called Jig Space,

456
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,640
which is, it's a sick app,

457
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,840
I don't know if I'd ever use it,

458
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,330
but basically it lets you load 3D models

459
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,000
into the space you're in and mess around with them,

460
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,730
take 'em apart, view them in actual size.

461
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,770
And this really takes advantage of how good

462
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,540
the placement lock is on the Vision Pro.

463
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,610
And you can walk around, and really gets you

464
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,920
a better understanding of the scale of things

465
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,410
that you don't get to see up close very often.

466
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,420
And then Keynote is another funny one.

467
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,780
So you can of course go through and edit a Keynote

468
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,340
just like normal if you want to,

469
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,280
but then they've built this whole environment

470
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,620
for practicing your presentation skills.

471
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,510
So you press that and it says, oh, would you like to go

472
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,930
to a conference room, or the literal Steve Jobs Theater,

473
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,720
so you can rehearse talking to your audience

474
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,850
with your Keynote slides behind you.

475
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,580
It is genuinely incredibly immersive.

476
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,200
And there's already a bunch more apps like this

477
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,550
in the App Store already at launch

478
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,520
that are specifically built for Vision Pro.

479
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,430
So they'll take advantage of its various strengths.

480
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,883
Now, are any of these a killer app?

481
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:49,763
Not really.

482
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:52,410
I mean I don't, if you're looking for any one of these

483
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,080
to be the reason why you spend like $4,000 on this headset,

484
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,390
I don't think we have that yet.

485
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,570
But then at least there's all the other non-native,

486
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,390
but technically still compatible, apps

487
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,740
that are in the App Store.

488
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,380
And these are gonna look just like iPhone and iPad apps.

489
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,260
Actually, there's a pre-installed folder on the home screen

490
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,950
when you get this thing literally called Compatible Apps,

491
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,230
and there's a bunch of them from Apple here.

492
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,970
They look exactly like iPad apps.

493
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,490
I'm surprised actually that more of them aren't

494
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,010
fully built out to take advantage of Vision Pro,

495
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,400
but like, Apple Maps is just the iPad app.

496
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,400
And so it would be cool if there were some fun

497
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,190
augmented reality overlay walking directions type stuff,

498
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,250
but nope, it's all the exact same functionality

499
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,350
that you would find if you opened this app on your iPad.

500
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,550
And you can go to the App Store

501
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,140
and search a bunch of the names of apps

502
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,750
you already know and love, and find them by name

503
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,880
and grab them, and they'll work the exact same way.

504
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,310
Crazily enough though, there are already

505
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,370
some notable exceptions.

506
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,120
No Netflix app for the Vision Pro, no YouTube app

507
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,960
for the Vision Pro, no Spotify app for the Vision Pro.

508
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,440
Apple has kind of a contentious relationship

509
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,730
with a lot of developers right now,

510
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,890
especially some of the bigger ones.

511
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,730
And so some have made the active choice to opt out.

512
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,770
They're like, we don't wanna be there.

513
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,620
This won't be a big enough platform to matter to us

514
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,670
to justify the work.

515
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,503
So they're not there.

516
00:20:15,503 --> 00:20:16,410
Now I totally get it,

517
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,420
but also now as a Vision Pro owner

518
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,920
and someone who's using it,

519
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,140
I'm like, oh, it's kind of a bummer.

520
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,520
I really wanted to be able to watch a Netflix show offline,

521
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,610
downloaded it ahead of time, but you can't do that now.

522
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,010
But at least, at least for now, for the record,

523
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,540
you can use the browser,

524
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,340
and anything that would work in the browser.

525
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,420
So if you pull up Safari,

526
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,330
and you get a full screen 4K YouTube video going,

527
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,510
and locked in space, or even in an environment,

528
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,343
it looks great.

529
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,400
It's razor sharp.

530
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,010
Like, I could totally watch YouTube videos like this.

531
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,740
But you will definitely be missing the features

532
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,410
of having the dedicated app, like offline video.

533
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,760
Honestly to me, the killer app of the Vision Pro

534
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,990
isn't just an app, it's actually the ecosystem.

535
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,220
And we knew this was coming,

536
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,880
but the second you log into a Vision Pro with your Apple ID,

537
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,400
immediately it starts pulling all the services,

538
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,780
and all the stuff that you're used to

539
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,360
from all the other Apple devices you already have.

540
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,010
And I said this before the Vision Pro was announced,

541
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,020
I was like, this is the most obvious strategy for Apple

542
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,030
because there are lots of people out there

543
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,520
who have never considered buying a VR headset

544
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,770
that are considering only this one

545
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,150
because they have an iPhone,

546
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,760
and this is the one that works with the iPhone,

547
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,440
and none of the others are particularly close.

548
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,420
So all of your iMessages are already here,

549
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,190
all of your photos are already here

550
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,930
and loaded up and backed up.

551
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,210
All your Notes are already at your fingertips.

552
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,710
You already saw the Keynote app.

553
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,620
But okay, easily my favorite feature

554
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,570
is connecting to your Mac, right?

555
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,310
So anytime your Mac is in front of you

556
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,110
and it's turned on, hit that arrow

557
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,310
and then there's this little icon

558
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,250
to Become My Mac's Virtual Display.

559
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,440
So I click that, and then pick my Mac,

560
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,720
and it pretty much instantly, it actually blacks out

561
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,260
the display of my Mac, and then turns that display

562
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,130
into a 4K window inside of the headset.

563
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,220
So now my keyboard and trackpad still work,

564
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,420
even if it is a desktop.

565
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,550
The keyboard and the trackpad still control everything,

566
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,310
and you can continue using it just like a normal computer,

567
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,280
but with the ability to make your new 4K monitor

568
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,630
as big or as small or close or far away as you want,

569
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,800
which is super sick.

570
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,710
And then the bonus is you can still open up

571
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,360
and place other Vision Pro apps around your Mac computer.

572
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,190
So like you can have your Mac in the middle here,

573
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,250
and maybe you're editing or doing some work on the Mac app,

574
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,490
and then you have a Safari window, or Messages,

575
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,490
or whatever else you want right next to it around it.

576
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,370
And then your keyboard and trackpad can move

577
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,600
seamlessly between them all to control all of them.

578
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,800
This, to me, as a Mac user, the ease of use for setup

579
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,360
to make this happen, this feels like

580
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,470
the biggest game changer,

581
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,650
like the most compelling futuristic feeling

582
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,330
use of this headset to me.

583
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,920
Especially on a plane.

584
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,450
Oh my god, I can't tell you how many times

585
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,130
I've had an awkward conversation because,

586
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,630
like, I'm editing a video on the plane,

587
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,000
the person next to me sees I'm editing a video of myself,

588
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,280
and it's kind of weird and hard to explain,

589
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,040
but I'm picturing putting the headset on,

590
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,510
the display blacks out,

591
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,370
but now I can do all the editing I want,

592
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,110
and I can make the screen as big as I want.

593
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,790
So I've really enjoyed using that feature.

594
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,590
Again, the biggest challenge, though,

595
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,190
is still remembering to look exactly at the thing

596
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,600
you want to control.

597
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,810
So aside from typing on the real keyboard

598
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,940
on whatever window is open, if you want

599
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,630
to control something, you have to be looking at it.

600
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,830
Again, it doesn't sound like a big deal,

601
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,050
but when you try it, you'll see what I mean.

602
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,830
And then also, odd limitation, one monitor only.

603
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,010
From the Mac, one virtual monitor only at a time.

604
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,560
So if you usually run a dual display setup like I do

605
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,080
for Final Cut Pro, big preview on one side,

606
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,270
timeline on the other side, you can't do that.

607
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:55,140
You have to use the big one monitor version of your setup.

608
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,850
All right, so you might have realized

609
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,030
I've left one thing out this whole time.

610
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,940
One thing, you could call it one more thing, sure.

611
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,030
It's one more huge crazy thing,

612
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,240
but it's kind of the defining characteristic of this product

613
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,910
and that is Personas.

614
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,870
So in all the advertising you've seen of Vision Pro,

615
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,200
there's these eyes on the outside of the headset

616
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,960
that looks like they're kind of in a passthrough,

617
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,960
like in a dark astronaut helmet type of thing.

618
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,420
Easily the most memed, most unique aspect

619
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,590
of this headset, right?

620
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,050
It's the only headset with an outward display.

621
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,380
And I mean it's very, very prominent in those videos,

622
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,990
but in real life, as you've started to see

623
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,770
from some of my footage, it is very different,

624
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,510
and I think I figured out why.

625
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,270
So first of all, it's not actually see-through, right?

626
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,680
There's a whole bunch of computer

627
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,270
in between me and you right now.

628
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,610
So the eyes aren't on the outside.

629
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,160
It's a representation of my eyes

630
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,680
based on what all the sensors on the inside are seeing.

631
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,150
It's reconstructing it on the outside.

632
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,660
So those sensors are tracking at 90 frames per second,

633
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,300
and they give you optic ID, which is,

634
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,370
it's how you log into the headset and keep things secure.

635
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,880
It's basically the same as face ID, or touch ID,

636
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,130
it's just looking at and identifying your eyes.

637
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,930
And it also powers the one beta feature of this headset,

638
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,670
which is Personas, which is, it's the most impressive

639
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,640
and weirdest thing about this headset at the same time.

640
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,540
I'm calling it right now.

641
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,700
So the purpose of the eyes on the outside

642
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,610
is really not for you, the wearer of the headset.

643
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,870
In fact, you'll never see it.

644
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,400
But it's for the people around you.

645
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,710
So when you're in a passthrough mode,

646
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,870
your eyes will shine through

647
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,390
to indicate that you wearing the headset

648
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,430
can see the person outside.

649
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,860
So that right there is already pretty unique.

650
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,840
But then, when you're in something immersive

651
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,480
and you can't see what's around you, it covers up your eyes

652
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,020
with this sort of like a blue, purple glowing animation.

653
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,400
So that intuitively makes sense.

654
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,720
You can see the eyes when they can see you,

655
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,190
you can't see the eyes when they can't see you.

656
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,900
But crazily enough, there's also a feature

657
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,930
where if you have someone who's outside the headset

658
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,280
looking at you, talking to you,

659
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,110
and you are in an immersion,

660
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,220
but you want to talk to them through that,

661
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,340
they will kind of appear through the fog

662
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,830
of whatever immersive environment you're in.

663
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,260
So you just start talking and looking in their direction.

664
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,070
It detects that, and sort of parts a little bit of a fog

665
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,070
and that person's eyes will show through the fog.

666
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,090
It's pretty decent.

667
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,760
It basically only shows one person at a time.

668
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,850
And when this is happening on the outside of the headset,

669
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,370
it shows a little bit of your eyes poking through

670
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,160
the purple and blue glow.

671
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,160
It's, as you can see, it's all working,

672
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,760
but also, I think it looks nothing like the eyes

673
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,593
from the ad.

674
00:26:42,593 --> 00:26:44,730
So in an effort to make the eyes

675
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,430
as presentable as possible, two things.

676
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:50,040
First of all, this screen is actually behind

677
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,640
a lenticular film, which I didn't even realize that

678
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,380
from the initial media they had published.

679
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,700
But if you've ever heard of that,

680
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,340
it's sort of what gives it this 3D depth.

681
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,860
You might have seen this on other holographic displays

682
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,270
and stuff, but the point of that

683
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:07,350
is to make the eyes appear to be sunken into the display,

684
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,180
like on your actual face,

685
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,060
instead of glued to the front of the headset,

686
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,320
which would look a little more weird.

687
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,680
But then two, to represent your actual eyes,

688
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,650
they've built in a way to scan in

689
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,890
and create a digital representation of your face,

690
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,110
which is called your Persona.

691
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,160
And it looks like this.

692
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,280
So to get those eyes on the outside

693
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,380
of the Vision Pro headset, you have to do something

694
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,780
called registering your Persona.

695
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,600
This is how it creates the digital version of you

696
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,110
that includes your eyes that will show up here.

697
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,090
So let's do that now.

698
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,620
It's actually kind of a cool process.

699
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,780
So I'm gonna put it on, and hopefully the screen recording

700
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,700
works so you can see exactly what I'm doing.

701
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,840
I'll hit the digital crown.

702
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,310
I'm gonna go to Settings.

703
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,960
And you can do this when you first set it up.

704
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,960
But I'm going to Persona, and I'm gonna hit Get Started.

705
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,900
So let's refine my hands real quick.

706
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,630
This is capturing detail from the front of the headset

707
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,193
of the hands in front of me.

708
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,583
Once it's done with that-

709
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,410
- [Automated Voice] Your Persona, remove Apple Vision Pro.

710
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,300
- It's gonna ask me to take it off.

711
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,923
So this is how it goes.

712
00:28:13,923 --> 00:28:15,060
- [Automated Voice] When you're ready,

713
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,013
hold Apple Vision Pro at eye level.

714
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,283
Keep your arms and shoulders relaxed.

715
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,700
Align your entire face within the frame.

716
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,650
- [Marques] My face shows up like face ID.

717
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,133
- [Automated Voice] Slowly turn your head to the right.

718
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,373
Now slowly turn your head to the left.

719
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,683
Now tilt your head up,

720
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,143
then tilt your head down.

721
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,660
Next, let's capture your facial expressions.

722
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,673
Smile with your mouth closed.

723
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,903
Then make a big smile with your teeth showing.

724
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,143
Now raise your eyebrows.

725
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,683
Close your eyes for a moment.

726
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,923
Capture complete.

727
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,223
Put Vision Pro back on to continue.

728
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,370
- I will do that.

729
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:15,303
So now I have a menu that says Creating Persona,

730
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,090
and it says it's in beta,

731
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:23,090
and now there's my Persona right there.

732
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,880
Kind of uncanny.

733
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,453
The hair's a little bit different, but the face.

734
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,260
Wow, wow.

735
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,093
Okay.

736
00:29:35,093 --> 00:29:35,926
So there's different lighting.

737
00:29:35,926 --> 00:29:37,650
You can choose it to always be in studio lighting,

738
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,180
and always be in contour lighting.

739
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,140
I'll just leave it at natural, and hit next.

740
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,280
You can change the color temperature of your skin tone.

741
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,870
Cool to warm, I think I'm around there.

742
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,630
Brightness, darkness.

743
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:58,113
I think I'm around there, near the middle.

744
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,170
Next.

745
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,190
And then I can add glasses.

746
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,690
So if I typically have glasses,

747
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,160
which obviously I wouldn't be able to wear

748
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,130
in the Vision Pro, you can still look like you have glasses,

749
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,680
anytime you're on that FaceTime call.

750
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,913
And then next.

751
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,363
Save.

752
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:15,196
And that's it.

753
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,710
So I think now

754
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,663
you should see my eyes.

755
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,133
Maybe.

756
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:30,540
And that that's the thing, it barely shows up.

757
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,840
You can barely see my eyes when I'm wearing the headset.

758
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,360
Now I've tried a couple other scans subsequently,

759
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,220
so I've tried different lighting conditions,

760
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,590
I've tried different backgrounds, simple backgrounds,

761
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,930
tried different shirts and things like that.

762
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,850
It doesn't really ever appear any brighter.

763
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,010
I think if you have a darker skin tone like me,

764
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,370
just don't expect the eyes to show up very brightly

765
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,420
on the outside of the headset.

766
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,470
It's pretty subtle.

767
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,980
Even when it does show up, it's a little weird looking.

768
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,500
The eyes are a little too far apart sometimes.

769
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,670
They're a little dim.

770
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,140
You see one eye at a time.

771
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,760
It's kind of weird.

772
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,787
But that Persona though.

773
00:31:04,787 --> 00:31:05,620
Whew.

774
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,740
That is some pretty interesting stuff.

775
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,820
It's crazy that this is actually a real thing being shipped,

776
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,560
like first Meta started doing it.

777
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,150
Now Apple's doing this.

778
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,700
This is, again, it's technically in beta.

779
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,950
So I dunno, there's room for improvement,

780
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,000
but it still works.

781
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,730
But as of right now, I feel like this is

782
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:28,730
both incredibly impressive and slightly unsettling.

783
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:32,250
Like, it's very impressive that this thing,

784
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,690
this headset I'm wearing on my face,

785
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:37,590
is tracking all these little micro expressions

786
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,990
and little movements for my eyes and my cheeks

787
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,120
and my mouth and everything.

788
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,120
But at the same time, it's just not quite human.

789
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,410
It's right at the edge of the uncanny valley

790
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,900
of I'm not looking at a person.

791
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,180
So yeah.

792
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:58,380
But the crazy part is you can now use this Persona

793
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,860
as your camera feed for any apps in Vision Pro

794
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,600
that require a front facing camera, like FaceTime.

795
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,480
And so I've tried, I've been using FaceTime

796
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,010
a few times in the Vision Pro,

797
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:15,480
and it is, technically speaking, incredible.

798
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,790
So I've made a few FaceTime calls in the past few days

799
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,230
with some fellow reviewers,

800
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,720
who you'll probably recognize from their Personas,

801
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,910
who are also testing the Vision Pro.

802
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:27,540
And universally, once we all got past the shock of,

803
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,400
oh my god, it's you.

804
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,720
It looks like a digital version of you.

805
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,553
This is crazy.

806
00:32:31,553 --> 00:32:33,120
I've never seen anything like this before.

807
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,810
Once we got past that, there is a ton happening here.

808
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,180
So you can see the FaceTime windows

809
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,190
literally appear as just that.

810
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,130
They're just like glassy windows floating in space

811
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,050
with people looking through them.

812
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:49,530
And then the angle that you look into the window

813
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:54,090
is gonna match the angle that they see you looking at them.

814
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,330
Meaning if we're all in Vision Pros on this call,

815
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,980
unlikely, but hear me out.

816
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,080
If we're all in Vision Pros,

817
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,030
and you've got a bunch of people on this FaceTime call,

818
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,470
so there's somebody to the left,

819
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,260
and somebody to the right, if I look to the person,

820
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,720
and make eye contact with the person to the right,

821
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,500
the person to the left sees the side of my head,

822
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,410
because I'm looking at somebody else.

823
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,940
That's already pretty cool.

824
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,800
And then the same thing is true for hand gestures.

825
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,940
So we tried this out.

826
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,620
Turns out you can reach out

827
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,530
and make hand gestures that are tracked by the cameras

828
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,760
in this bubble in front of you,

829
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,790
and they show up at the correct angle

830
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,860
towards the person that you're gesturing at,

831
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,470
so not towards everybody else on the call.

832
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,310
Oh wait, wait, wait.

833
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,143
Okay, good test.

834
00:33:36,143 --> 00:33:37,650
So wait, Justine, do you see this?

835
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:38,483
- Yes.

836
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,316
- And Brian, do you see? - I don't see that.

837
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:40,350
I don't see that, Marques. - Whoa.

838
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,723
- Now wait.

839
00:33:41,723 --> 00:33:42,556
So now Brian, do you see this? (Justine gasps)

840
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:43,590
- Now I can see that, Marques.

841
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,750
- And then on top of that, spatial audio here

842
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,250
is incredibly well developed.

843
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,280
So again, you're on the call, the voice of the person

844
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,140
to the right comes from the right side.

845
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,300
The voice of the person to the left comes from the left.

846
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,970
But also, you can just pick up and move the window around,

847
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:01,410
and that angle will match where the people are in the room

848
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,660
and where their sound and video comes from.

849
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,300
If I put you on the other side of the room,

850
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,850
it sounds like they're further away.

851
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,000
And if I turn up the environment,

852
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,380
and bring them into the moon, or some other 3D space,

853
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,130
it actually sounds much more like I'm in a gigantic space

854
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,710
with no echo, versus in the actual room.

855
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,470
It's all very subtle, but very well considered.

856
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,670
So once you're in this a while,

857
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,310
you start to notice all these little smaller things.

858
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,500
Again, it's not quite human-like.

859
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,203
It's not like looking at a video feed of a human face,

860
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,740
but it is still, like it has a lot of like,

861
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,590
this would be the best avatar anyone's ever made in 2K.

862
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,240
Like no one's ever done a 2K face scan

863
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,650
and had it look this good,

864
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,620
but it's still not as good as a perfect reality.

865
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,770
It's a, you've heard the uncanny valley thing before.

866
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,710
I think the number one weakness for the avatars

867
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,200
or the Personas that I've seen is hair.

868
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,940
So basically everyone I've talked to has

869
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,830
like a frozen lump of hair

870
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,170
instead of flowing realistic hair.

871
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,970
And that's true about all flowing things,

872
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,580
like however your hair was when you did the scan,

873
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,870
it's frozen that way.

874
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,880
And so is any necklace you're wearing,

875
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,620
whether it's crooked or not,

876
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,890
or I guess, technically also any makeup you had on,

877
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,510
or however you looked when you did the scan.

878
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,267
Maybe that could be a good thing.

879
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:19,080
Maybe you did a scan when you were looking all dolled up,

880
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,760
and then you get on a 7:00 AM call,

881
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,500
and you still look perfect even though

882
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,030
you look like you just woke up in real life.

883
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,980
So I guess there's that too.

884
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,440
But anyway, all that is to say FaceTime.

885
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,300
FaceTime is the most well thought out,

886
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,920
like most futuristic Vision Pro experience.

887
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,753
It just is.

888
00:35:38,753 --> 00:35:40,380
So I'll end this video with this.

889
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,380
Now you know what it's like to use and operate

890
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,740
the Vision Pro.

891
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,540
But there's still a lot more to consider

892
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,640
when actually considering if you should buy

893
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,520
and own this thing, from the use cases,

894
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,220
to the things that work well, and don't work well,

895
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,580
the philosophy behind it, the prices, all of that stuff.

896
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,280
That's what's gonna be for my full review.

897
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,510
Like there are parts of this thing

898
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,760
that are absolutely amazing,

899
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,250
unparalleled, best I've ever seen.

900
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,810
But the reason it's so interesting

901
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,180
is because it's actually a young category.

902
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,750
Like we're so used to this slow, boring iteration

903
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,450
in mature categories, like smartphones, and laptops,

904
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,500
and you always see the comments

905
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,540
talking about how tech is so boring,

906
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,580
but now they're actually jumping into something risky,

907
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,420
and it's actually fun, and there is downfalls and flaws,

908
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,910
and it's fun to actually weigh the pros and cons.

909
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,590
So I'll be expanding on all these way more

910
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,510
in the full review, but I'll leave you with this.

911
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:37,350
I've got my upsides and downsides to Vision Pro.

912
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,310
It's been a week.

913
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,473
Upsides, some of the stuff that's the best I've ever seen

914
00:36:40,473 --> 00:36:41,580
in a headset.

915
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,330
Immersion, placement in space, eye tracking

916
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:49,650
and hand control, passthrough, ecosystem,

917
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,420
and spatial audio.

918
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,660
And the downsides, weight and comfort,

919
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,490
the eyes on the outside,

920
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:01,290
app selection right now, battery life, and price.

921
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,210
So the full reviews in the works.

922
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,280
Definitely get subscribed to be among the first

923
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,080
to see that when it drops.

924
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,660
Either way, till the next one.

925
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,220
Thanks for watching.

926
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,510
Catch you later.

927
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,343
Peace.
