1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,640
what happened to Apple Vision Pro in the

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:06,120
six months since I bought mine The

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,440
Narrative around this product has

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,639
changed drastically from Apple's

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,519
Visionary new product is the most

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,639
technologically advanced ever to the

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,760
Apple Vision Pro is a dud flop and a

8
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:21,240
miss but why what the hell happened in

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,439
the course of 6 months to justify that

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,199
change is the Vision Pro actually a flop

11
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:29,519
and would I recommend buying one first

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,880
let me take you through what I've

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,840
actually been using mine for the first

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,600
big thing I've been using the Vision Pro

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,840
for is for novelty experiences the

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,360
dinosaur encounter is the best example

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,840
of this oh it's looking right at me holy

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,399
sh

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,000
holy I knew it was going to do this that

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,719
your walls open up into the Jurassic age

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,039
and a giant dinosaur looks right at you

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,800
as it steps through your living room

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,280
other apps like Kung Fu Panda's

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,399
meditation lessons and Disney Marvel's

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,280
what if offers similar experiences what

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,040
makes these experiences so novel and

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,920
compelling is how the Vision Pro can

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,280
make you feel like the characters and

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,560
creatures you're seeing can also see you

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,479
well yes other headsets like the quest 3

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,479
offer similar experiences The Vision Pro

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,400
sells this illusion of presence way more

33
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,520
thanks to its better displays graphics

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,720
and performance another immersive

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,000
experience can transport you to Mount

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,680
Hood or the surface surf of the Moon in

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,600
what Apple calls environments these are

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,600
mainly places in the real world that

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,040
have been recreated to make it feel like

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,600
you're right there though some apps like

41
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,920
Disney plus and Max have created their

42
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,759
own like the throne room from Game of

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,600
Thrones the purpose of these

44
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,680
environments is to help block out

45
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,560
everything around you so you can focus

46
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,399
on completing a certain task or you just

47
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,960
want to have a space to have a giant

48
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,600
screen to watch something on meditating

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,520
in these environments can also be fun

50
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,159
Apple's updated meditation app for The

51
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,240
Vision Pro has this very soothing 3D

52
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,440
breathing guide now one of the best

53
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,280
parts of Oni A Vision Pro is watching

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,360
other people try it on Via guest mode

55
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,920
it's hilarious seeing other people react

56
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,160
to the dinosaur coming right at them but

57
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,040
again that's novelty it's the thing that

58
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,160
gets you excited about a product and

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,120
then perhaps buy it but it's rarely the

60
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,080
thing that actually keeps you using it

61
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,319
over the long term and that leads me to

62
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,120
the vision Pro's next big feature which

63
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,120
is Apple immersive video Apple immersive

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,040
video is a new format that makes you

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,280
feel like you've been put right in the

66
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,360
middle of a 180Â° IMAX movie the people

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,360
and animals you see feel real I just

68
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,480
couldn't stop smiling watching this mini

69
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,080
do about a rhino Sanctuary especially in

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,959
the shot where it just looks like the

71
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,120
rhinos are right in front of you and you

72
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,920
could just Reach Out And Touch them it

73
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,000
sells the illusion that well and through

74
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,159
an apple immersive video trailer apple

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,280
is actually shown off what live sports

76
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:06,280
footage can look like in this format and

77
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,400
it is also just insane like it makes you

78
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,599
feel like you're sitting courtside at a

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,200
Lakers game or you're on the sidelines

80
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:15,280
during the Super Bowl it is by far the

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,920
most compelling Sports viewing

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,120
experience I've ever experienced outside

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,879
of actually being at the game to me it's

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,000
one of the most compelling things about

85
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,720
Vision Pro and there's more content

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,080
coming to The Vision Pro including the

87
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,000
first ever scripted show in this format

88
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,720
from Oscar winning director Edward

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,360
burger and speaking of content the last

90
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,280
main thing I've been using the Vision

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,959
Pro for is watching 2D movies and TV

92
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,120
shows unless you have a giant theater in

93
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,280
your home nothing else will come close

94
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,280
to the experience of watching content on

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,439
Vision Pro this headset is the same to

96
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,280
TVs and movie theaters as what the

97
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:56,760
airpods are to stereo systems and

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,120
speakers and yes you can watch 3D movies

99
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,959
as well though I've mainly stuck to 2D

100
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,720
movies as some 3D movies with a screen

101
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,840
as large as what you get in the Vision

102
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,959
Pro I've noticed it can cause me to get

103
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,560
a bit motion sick now while I don't use

104
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,599
the Vision Pro as much as my TV there

105
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,280
are two main use cases where I found I

106
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,160
prefer it to watch content on one is

107
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,400
when I'm traveling and I don't have a

108
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,360
great TV setup like when I was at the

109
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,840
beach and I wanted to watch the latest

110
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,680
episode of House of dragon I've also

111
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,520
found it useful for when I want to watch

112
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,680
TV during the day where unlike my TV

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,000
there there's no glare from surrounding

114
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,880
Windows the sound quality of the vision

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,240
Pro's dual driver audio pods is actually

116
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,800
pretty good I didn't immediately feel

117
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,400
the need to reach for my earbuds when I

118
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,720
was watching something however using a

119
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,800
set of Apple's newest version of airpods

120
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,520
Pro with the USBC case those do

121
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,759
significantly improve the audio

122
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,199
experience of the Vision Pro by blocking

123
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,759
out background noise and providing way

124
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:03,039
better bass so what have I not used the

125
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,000
Vision Pro 4 first is using it for work

126
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,800
you can use it with a Mac to create a

127
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,639
giant virtual Mac window which is great

128
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,080
for when you're working off a Macbook or

129
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,280
MacBook Air and want to view content on

130
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,360
a larger screen the second work use case

131
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,720
is having a bunch of apps in multiple

132
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,880
virtual Windows around you but I find

133
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,960
that use case less compelling it looks

134
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,120
cool and it does allow you to Conta

135
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,840
switched faster meaning you can move

136
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,199
from one task to another and then back

137
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,280
to the other task but that context

138
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,960
switching is more mentally taxing I do

139
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,199
like that I can just move a window

140
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,520
completely out of view to focus on

141
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,639
another window though now would I use

142
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,280
Vision Pro to replace my studio display

143
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,039
no using the studio display as my

144
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,720
monitor is just more comfortable

145
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,120
depending on the person and the

146
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,160
situation I can see a use case for when

147
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,240
you're traveling without a monitor and

148
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,639
using the Vision Pro with your MacBook

149
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,039
for quick spurts when you want a larger

150
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,360
display the environments can be nice to

151
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,720
work in because they help block out all

152
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,800
the distractions around you it's like

153
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,880
noise cancellation for your vision

154
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,280
though I'm not sure I'd have the courage

155
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,199
to wear it in a coffee shop just yet

156
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,919
gaming is another thing I haven't found

157
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,000
myself using the Vision Pro 4 I've tried

158
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,840
a few and looked at plenty of games out

159
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,720
there for it but they're either too

160
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,360
expensive for me to want to really try

161
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,080
them out or they just haven't really

162
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,160
appealed to me though I'm the type of

163
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,319
gamer that plays very few games but of

164
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,880
the games I do play i s a lot of hours

165
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,120
into them so this might just be a me

166
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,680
thing FaceTime is another feature I

167
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,080
haven't used I've used it once to scare

168
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,039
my family members with my Persona which

169
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,720
The Vision Pro creates when it scans

170
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,400
your face during initial setup the last

171
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,840
thing I haven't found myself using

172
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,479
Vision Pro for at all is specifically

173
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,440
for airline travel mainly because of its

174
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:56,039
size if you're already bringing a

175
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,599
carryon bag and a personal item onto a

176
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,919
plane The Vision Pro in its case is

177
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:03,240
going to take up a lot of space in one

178
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:05,680
of those bags though yes you could just

179
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,039
take the Vision Pro like this and put it

180
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,720
directly into one of your bags though

181
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:13,319
given how much this device costs and how

182
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,240
fragile some of its components are I'm

183
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,879
not sure I'd recommend doing that so if

184
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,599
the Vision Pro can do some pretty

185
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,960
incredible things why did it fade so

186
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:26,599
quickly and why do people consider it a

187
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,759
flop do I consider it a flop no not

188
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,759
necessarily it depends on how you look

189
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,400
at the Vision Pro Pro its underlying

190
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:36,120
technology platform and the product

191
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,800
itself when looking at the underlying

192
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,319
technology platform I think Apple

193
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,159
actually did what they set out to do the

194
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,680
highresolution micro OLED panels that's

195
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:48,800
the tech responsible for creating such a

196
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,840
crisp image with outstanding color

197
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,479
reproduction and contrast they also move

198
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,960
the Vision Pro will actually scan the

199
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:59,000
distance between your eyes to align the

200
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,000
displays perfectly for that 3D depth

201
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,759
effect which is key to viewing

202
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,039
everything in the Vision Pro like

203
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,199
spatial photos and videos while the

204
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,000
spatial photos and videos captured on my

205
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,800
iPhone 15 Pro Max aren't nearly as

206
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,240
impressive as the ones captured on the

207
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,440
Vision Pro itself thanks to the better

208
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,840
depth effect it creates even today I

209
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,080
think spatial photos and videos are

210
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,560
compelling though somewhat limiting

211
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,720
since better videos can only be taken

212
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,039
with Vision Pro and overall their

213
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,599
resolution and Clarity isn't as crystal

214
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,240
clear as you want it to be hopefully

215
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,800
that'll improve over time oddly enough

216
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,440
for me today panoramas are the most

217
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,800
impressive photo video feature on Vision

218
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,599
Pro because it can recreate the

219
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,600
perspective you had when you took the

220
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,959
Panorama and its high res so it looks

221
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,279
really impressive the lidar and Camera

222
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,880
Suite is another incredible technology

223
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,279
packed into Vision Pro it's the reason

224
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,560
the tracking and placement of virtual

225
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,120
objects in your environment feels so

226
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,440
damn real the camera Suite also helps

227
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,920
power Apple's hand and eye tracking

228
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,720
which is actually quite good it allows

229
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,480
you to look at something with your eyes

230
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,880
and pinch your fingers together to

231
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,040
select it though parts of the experience

232
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,200
over the past 6 months have still felt a

233
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,720
bit clunky like when watching Apple

234
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,839
immersive videos often when you glance

235
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,640
up the little dot for the control center

236
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,959
constantly appears with its default

237
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,120
setting though Apple has addressed this

238
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,240
with a new hand gesture in Vision OS 2

239
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,680
which comes out later this year here and

240
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,240
sometimes I find the eye tracking to be

241
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,519
a bit fatiguing honestly when you're

242
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,040
always having to look at the thing

243
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,360
you're trying to select and then

244
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,880
sometimes you like look at the wrong

245
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,279
thing you select the wrong thing and

246
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,120
yeah now the last major Hardware

247
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,720
breakthrough with Vision Pro is the R1

248
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,920
chip to make the eye and hand tracking

249
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,600
as well as object placement work so

250
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,800
quickly that you can't perceive any lag

251
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,399
Apple had to design a chip separate from

252
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,079
the normal processor to run all of those

253
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,959
tasks now now does the R1 chip mean you

254
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:06,360
can't get any motion sickness while

255
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,680
wearing Vision Pro no but it does

256
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,760
significantly reduce the chances of that

257
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,399
happening I've only noticed getting

258
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,399
motion sick when watching a 3D movie

259
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,880
occasionally when walking around with a

260
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,519
headset on and my eyes are dry or in a

261
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,760
situation where the tracking goes

262
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,440
berserk like when my Apple TV screen

263
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,440
saver turned on in a dimly lit room and

264
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,880
the headset decided to track against

265
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,760
that overall Vision Pro's underlying

266
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,959
technology ol is insanely impressive but

267
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,839
where the Vision Pro will likely feel

268
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,079
like a flop to some is all of the issues

269
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,040
with the product experience the weight

270
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,639
of the device is the most glaring issue

271
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,240
Apple Vision Pro can weigh 600 to 650 g

272
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,600
depending on the light seal and headband

273
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,399
configuration and that's just too damn

274
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,880
heavy for most people worse is Apple

275
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,720
shipped to pretty garbage headbands for

276
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,959
Distributing the weight of the Vision

277
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,440
Pro around around your head the first is

278
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,639
the solo nit band which has an awesome

279
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,279
adjustable dial and great fabric

280
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,320
material however Apple decided not to

281
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,279
ship it with the optional head strap

282
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,399
which they originally showed off at WWDC

283
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,920
they instead shipped the solo knit band

284
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,200
with the additional dual Loop band the

285
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,560
problem is the Dual Loop band is harder

286
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,760
to adjust and the bottom strap doesn't

287
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,360
cover as much of your head as the solo

288
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,959
knit band does for weight distribution

289
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,160
wearing the Vision Pro with the solo

290
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,720
knit band without any additional type of

291
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,480
head strap over top that's typically

292
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,839
going to cause the Vision Pro to dig

293
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,880
into your cheeks or your forehead as you

294
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,279
continue to wear it to remedy that

295
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,839
you'll either try to move it or further

296
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,440
tighten it and it's easy to overtighten

297
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:49,160
it to the point where it can cause

298
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,120
headaches migraines and general Facial

299
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,440
Pain wearing Vision Pro gave me the

300
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,040
first migraine I've ever experienced in

301
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,920
my entire life and it got so bad that I

302
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,279
just really regretted buying a Vision

303
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,760
Pro but thankfully a third party

304
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:05,040
accessory maker came to my rescue I

305
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,200
bought this speeden Vision Pro headstrap

306
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,360
which is a similar design to what Apple

307
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,920
originally showed off with the solo nit

308
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,720
band and should have shipped even with

309
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,720
this strap and they're not a sponsor by

310
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,079
the way even with the strap The Vision

311
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,680
Pro it does still feel heavy yes but

312
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,440
it's not unmanageable since getting it

313
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,920
I've been able to comfortably wear

314
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,519
Vision Pro for well over an hour with no

315
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,079
Facial Pain or headaches afterward I've

316
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,079
left a link to it and the other

317
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,920
accessories for Vision Pro in the blog

318
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,240
post for this review at 6months l.net

319
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,120
link to that in the description below

320
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,680
now there is one more Comfort problem

321
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,160
though that Still Remains for me with

322
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,360
Vision Pro and that's eye strain and eye

323
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,000
fatigue because we all tend to Blink

324
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,519
less when we look at displays and

325
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,160
screens our eyes will then dry out feel

326
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,480
more strained and fatigued which is why

327
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,399
you've probably heard of the 202020 rule

328
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,920
where every 20 minutes you're supposed

329
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,360
to look at something 20 ft away for at

330
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,120
least 20 seconds well that's kind of

331
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,120
hard to do in The Vision Pro if you're

332
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,120
watching a movie it's not really

333
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,240
practical now I've noticed this is worse

334
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,360
when wearing contacts versus glasses

335
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,279
with headsets like Vision Pro if you do

336
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,720
wear contacts one thing I found that's

337
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,639
really helped me after a long session

338
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,680
with Vision Pro is getting some eye

339
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,279
drops like these and just putting a few

340
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,320
drops in each eye to help refreshen them

341
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,160
and cause them not to be as dry now what

342
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,399
about battery life 2 hours sounds like

343
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,320
not that much but when you take the ey

344
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,880
strain plus the weight of the device

345
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,079
into account to me the battery life has

346
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,399
actually been pretty adequate and if you

347
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,720
want to use Vision Pro longer you always

348
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,560
have the option to plug it in now

349
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,399
another reason why people might feel

350
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,680
like The Vision Pro is a flop is app

351
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:53,240
availability most of the apps just

352
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,680
provide novelty but again novelty can

353
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,800
only get you so far I just haven't

354
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,399
really found anything that's kept me

355
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,560
wanting to come back and use the headset

356
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,480
outside of core content apps like the

357
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,920
max app but the content app availability

358
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,759
is lacking 6 months in there's not an

359
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,639
official Netflix or YouTube app now one

360
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,720
reason developers of larger apps might

361
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,160
have been more hesitant to develop for

362
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,720
the Vision Pro is Apple's business model

363
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,199
for it the company has called Vision Pro

364
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,000
its first spatial computer I don't know

365
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,320
about you but when I hear the word

366
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,759
computer I typically think of file

367
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,959
systems open protocols oh and the

368
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:33,720
ability to download software freely

369
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,199
outside of Apple's App Store wal Garden

370
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,880
The Vision Pro isn't that it's more like

371
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:41,560
a spatial iPad and I think the software

372
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,240
development for this device has suffered

373
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,120
because of that the last thing about the

374
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,800
Vision Pro that I think contributes to

375
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,880
this feeling like this product is a flop

376
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,800
is Apple just over engineered it

377
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,600
eyesight is a good example of this it

378
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,040
makes it sort of look like you can see

379
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,240
the person's eyes as they look at you

380
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,160
while wearing Vision Pro but in in

381
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,519
reality from most angles it looks kind

382
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,639
of goofy oddly when looking at yourself

383
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,920
in the mirror though it looks pretty

384
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,160
decent Motions like when you blink your

385
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,920
eyes happen pretty much in real time

386
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,279
which is impressive now in order to get

387
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,360
eyesight to work Apple needed to create

388
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:21,560
a 3D scan of your face which is your

389
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,880
Apple Persona now how well my facial

390
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,600
movements here map to my Persona and

391
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:29,360
blinking the eyes everything that is

392
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,639
impressive but the end result is still a

393
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,639
little bit uh yikes Vision Pro's fit is

394
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,519
also complex Apple made like 30s

395
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,279
something different light seals for it

396
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,880
depending on which light seal you're

397
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,800
fitted with the field of view or the

398
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,079
amount of virtual space that you see

399
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,759
when you put the Vision Pro on can

400
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,839
actually decrease luckily I was fitted

401
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:54,160
with the 21w seal which has a decent

402
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,279
field of view another complication with

403
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,480
the Vision Pro Design is you can't wear

404
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,360
glasses while wearing the headset you'll

405
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,880
need to upload your prescription and

406
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,240
Order Zeiss Optical inserts which

407
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,160
magnetically pop into the Vision Pro and

408
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,920
cost anywhere from 100 to

409
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,600
$150 another downside with Vision Pro is

410
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,279
there's no multi-user support if you

411
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,560
live with somebody else that also wants

412
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,360
to use this on occasion every time they

413
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,680
want to use it they have to use guest

414
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,199
mode which means they have to reset up

415
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,440
their hand and eye tracking every single

416
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:28,639
time they use the headset there's also a

417
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,920
Content DRM that basically prevents you

418
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,480
from doing any screen recordings while

419
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,680
watching any movies or TV shows which

420
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,839
makes sharing how great the movie

421
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,240
watching experience is on social pretty

422
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,319
difficult you can also see Reflections

423
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,839
and some minimal glare towards the

424
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:48,240
bottom of the lens when viewing content

425
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,079
which some might find to be a

426
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,880
downside so do I recommend getting an

427
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:57,079
apple Vision Pro for almost everyone out

428
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,880
there the answer to that question is no

429
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,519
novelty will only entertain for so long

430
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,199
and

431
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:07,240
$3,500 is a lot to spend on novelty plus

432
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:09,679
a giant virtual TV and computer monitor

433
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,240
even for the use cases I use it for

434
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,919
you're probably better off getting a 75

435
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,760
or heck even an 83 in OLED television

436
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,880
and you'd still spend less than

437
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,919
$3500 and you could watch content with

438
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:28,960
other people but what if it wasn't

439
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,919
$3,500 what if it was $1,500

440
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,720
at that price I might very well

441
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,840
recommend it depending on what

442
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,080
trade-offs Apple made to get it down to

443
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,760
that price the TV watching and apple

444
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,679
immersive video format are compelling if

445
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,520
they could somehow keep the excellent

446
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,799
displays make the device lighter I think

447
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,919
it would be a better product so overall

448
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:52,200
yes I have found a use for the Vision

449
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,799
Pro that does keep me coming back to the

450
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,000
headset time and time again I don't

451
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,280
think the device is a total flop the

452
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,360
technology platform Apple developed is

453
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,600
seriously impressive but I don't

454
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,320
recommend getting the device because too

455
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,799
many of the products downsides outweigh

456
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,720
its highlights it's a device that feels

457
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,480
like something from the future but is

458
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,320
hampered by the present form factor

459
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,000
business model and extra features Apple

460
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,440
decided to go

461
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,600
with if you want to learn even more

462
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,120
about the Vision Pro and how it compares

463
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,799
to the much cheaper meta Quest 3 as well
