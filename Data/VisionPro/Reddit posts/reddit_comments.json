Vision Pro market isn’t mature like iPhones. People forget that those beer drinking apps were $4-5 at first too. I think I had an iPad interactive periodic table app that was $29 at launch. \n\nThe only people with Vision Pro right now are people with money. $10-$15 for a cool demo to show my friends? Yeah sure. "

This app is ***wonderful***, and might convince me to buy an AVP if I didn't already own one. I'm now spreading the word, and am looking forward to seeing whatever new environments you come up with.

However, many people don’t see the value proposition in spending thirteen dollars for an app that has minimal practical use cases, myself included. Hoping the price comes down someday, because it is a cool app (but sort of gimmicky), but the value proposition isn’t there at this point."

They should be wrapped with codes if they stay still. If not, run.\n* In rare cases, the effect might look glitchy on first uses. See [FAQ](https://www.notion.so/Magic-Room-Support-59eb256c82d04e3ea55784cf67641fff?pvs=21) for simple fixes.\n* The effect works the best with flat surfaces such as walls and ceilings. It should also wrap around irregular objects reasonably well.\n* Please suggest new room transformation ideas - would love to make popular requests happen!\n\nCheers"

Very expensive for a gimmick at the moment. \n\nBut the vision pro is going to be refined, and cheaper models will come out. \n\nIf op does something like that, it might be fine. Charge 10 dollars for the first year. Then run sales.  Add more content and make it better over time. \n\n—\n\nI know personally, I don’t buy shit at crazy prices if I don’t get the value. I didn’t even buy the Vision Pro and will wait for the 2nd gen. \n\nAnd frankly, for what I see, this app is 5 bucks at most. No promises of new content. No settings to change color, font, content. Speed?\n\nAs a pc gamer, I refuse to pay full price for an unfinished product. But if I saw this on sale for like 3 bucks in a few years, I could imagine impulse buying it. \n\n—\n\nAnother fun though a very niche feature would be a wedding proposal. Imagine as asking your partner to try the app. \n\nIt’s all words, then suddenly there’s a line of code that’s blue instead of red. She squints to read it. It gets bigger. “Will you marry me?”\n\nShe smiles and glances towards you, and you’re a glowing green matrix dude holding a ring that shines with the power of the sun. \n\nStill super niche though lol."

But actually using it I've run into some issues.\n\nThe main issue is that holding the crown button resets your view. This is actually pretty nice because you can have your workflow around your laptop, move to the couch, hold that button, and have all the windows snap back around the laptop where they were. But that will also move the windows you want fixed in place (eg on the fridge).\n\nThere's also no \"expose\" type functionality to quickly explode out all your windows and peek at them. When I put windows all over, it was fun and cute, but then you kind of forget which ones are where, and while it's neat to have your grocery list on the fridge, it sucks to have to get up and walk to the fridge to see if something is on it, like we're in the 90s again.\n\nI think this video shows where we're headed, but I don't think we're quite there yet. VisionOS needs to grow a bit more functionality, but we'll get there. The first iPhone didn't have copy/paste, but someone from back then using an iPhone 15 would be overwhelmed since it was a new paradigm and all its idioms hadn't been internalized yet."

I hope you can get some real practical work done with the headset but if not, it’s a learning experience and it will help them develop something that will do that.  It would be killer to have this headset work in Microsoft flight simulator, and DCS world. If you’ve never flown a simulator in VR before it’s spectacular and I know the Vision Pro would make the experience even better if it weren’t on PC. Because of the hand tracking and better graphics, you could look down and see the labels on your dials and be able to flip the switches much easier and more naturally than the other headset.  If I remember correctly, X-PLANE 11 works on Mac, so maybe I’ll see a review on YouTube of someone trying that sooner or later.  That’s not as good as being fully immersed and being able to look around the cockpit, which is absolutely amazing if you’ve never tried it before"

I had a cell phone and an MP3 player & when my daughter came to visit from college with an iPhone 4 I was blown away and went and got one right away in spite of others mocking me because of the price, but I and have never looked back. Most of those who ridiculed me also have iPhones now. \nI have problems using a PC/Mac due to back & neck issues. I also have problems with the straight keyboard and use an ergonomic one. When the iPad was first announced, I may have been first in line to place an order. When it came, people laughed at me for paying that kind of money and couldn’t see the point. Now you see iPads everywhere. The number of apps available compared to the start is amazing.\nThe type of work I do the AVP would be nice except for the keyboard issue. I’m not a gamer, and I never sit down to watch a full movie or anything at one time so an AVP is not an advantage there either. At some point, possibly next GEN I will get one, just because I love cool tech to play with & the AVP is very special."

Everything else is sort of a qualitative / marginal improvement over previous things that existed. But this idea of genuine depth perception with true real time scene modeling is tantalising for what it can mean. It feels like Apple has chosen fairly superficial things to highlight for marketing purposes because they appeal to mass market easily (yay we can watch movies ... like we have in VR for 10+ years now ...). But the real exciting capabilities here are yet to be revealed / highlighted because they take much more time and nuance for people to understand them."

That's confirmed coming to Quest 3 within the year."
